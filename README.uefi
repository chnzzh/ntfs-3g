This README file describes the compilation of ntfs-3g as a UEFI driver

Linux (EDK2)
------------

This assumes that you have gcc (5.0 or later) and the EDK2 installed.
For this example, we assume that EDK2 is located in /usr/src/edk2.

Open a command prompt at the top of this repository and issue:

export WORKSPACE=$PWD
export EDK2_PATH=/usr/src/edk2
export PACKAGES_PATH=$WORKSPACE:$EDK2_PATH
source $EDK2_PATH/edksetup.sh --reconfig
build -a X64 -b RELEASE -t GCC5 -p uefi-driver.dsc

You may also use IA32, ARM, AARCH64 or RISCV64 for the -a parameter to build a
driver for these architectures noting however that you need to have the relevant
toolchain and GCC prefix set.

For instance, to compile for ARM, ARM64 and RISCV64, you would need to also issue:

export GCC5_ARM_PREFIX=arm-linux-gnueabi-
export GCC5_AARCH64_PREFIX=aarch64-linux-gnu-
export GCC5_RISCV64_PREFIX=riscv64-linux-gnu-
